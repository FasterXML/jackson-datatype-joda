Project to build Jackson (http://jackson.codehaus.org) module (jar)
to support JSON serialization and deserialization of
Joda (http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/) data types.

## Status

[![Build Status](https://fasterxml.ci.cloudbees.com/job/jackson-datatype-joda-master/badge/icon)](https://fasterxml.ci.cloudbees.com/job/jackson-datatype-joda-master/)

As of version 2.0 module is usable and relatively extensive (more so than in-built support 1.9 had). Contributions are welcome!

## Usage

### Maven dependency

To use module on Maven-based projects, use following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype</groupId>
  <artifactId>jackson-datatype-joda</artifactId>
  <version>2.1.1</version>
</dependency>    
```

(or whatever version is most up-to-date at the moment)

### Registering module


Like all standard Jackson modules (libraries that implement Module interface), registration is done as follows:

```java
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
mapper.registerModule(new JodaModule());
```

after which functionality is available for all normal Jackson operations:
you can read JSON as Joda types, as well as write Joda values as JSON.
